# Training and Test set for Dynamic Reverse Analysis

  [1] if you want to train the data, go to the training folder.

  [2] if you want to subtract the background using forward model, go to the Directional Forward folder.

  [3] if you want to subtract the background using backward model, go to the Directional backward folder.

  [4] if you want to measure the similarity between the backward and forward models, go to the similarity folder.

  [5] if you want to subtract the background using hybrid model, go to the hybrid_model folder.

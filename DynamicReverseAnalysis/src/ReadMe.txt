[1] if you want to train the data, go to the training folder.

[2] if you want to subtract the background using forward model, go to the Directional Forward folder.

[3] if you want to subtract the background using backward model, go to the Directional backward folder.

[4] if you want to measure the similarity between the backward and forward models, go to the similarity folder.

[5] if you want to subtract the background using hybrid model, go to the hybrid_model folder.

For the first run, each of the steps above should be executed in sequence.
